## about datalab

Youth audiences in particular are expecting the best content to be available to them in a single place, personalised to their preferences and interests. At the moment this is almost impossible for the BBC, since our content and audience data is distributed across myriad systems that are hard to connect. Additionally our content metadata is lacking, which makes it challenging to discover content. We are currently unable to properly engage the next generation of TV license fee payers, many of whom already have less affinity with the BBC than the rest of the UK population does.

The BBC Datalab was formed to address these issues, amongst others, by creating a simpler way to discover content. We do this by bringing together everything we know about all BBC content in one place (the Content Graph) and using machine learning to enrich it (i.e. create additional metadata), so that we can identify content which is most relevant to individuals' interests and context. Our approach is to build a data “platform”, which can be extended by other BBC teams, and which allows many different products to use the data to create more consistent and relevant experiences for our audiences.

## our team values

**We are ambitious and tenacious**

We are excited by solving big problems and are tenacious in achieving our ambitious goals, but accept that this can take time and we may not succeed at the first attempt. 

**Diversity and opportunity**

Job descriptions and job titles are left at the door.  Everyone has equal right to contribute ideas and be heard.  We delight in sharing knowledge, expertise and learning - two heads are always better than one.

**We are empowered, responsible and accountable**

We always write our own narrative, and are proactive, not reactive, in our choices.  We don't blame others or find excuses, but take ownership of our own destiny.  We hold ourselves, and each other, to account, and highlight good and bad behaviour to help us all improve.

**We are strong; disagree and commit**

We don’t accept poor decisions simply for an easy life or to appease those more senior or more outspoken, and can disagree without fear of repercussions. We do commit 100% once a decision has been made. 

**Audiences are our ultimate focus**

If we don’t understand and can’t measure the benefit to audiences, we won’t do it.  We constantly test our priorities against what we learn about our audiences, and what they tell us they like and need. 

**We create value, not just code**

We advance the BBC’s knowledge and create a lasting legacy.  We deliver for the whole BBC, not just for our team. 

**We create space for new ideas**

We have the confidence to explore new ideas, and make time for audience-focused innovation and “play”.  

We think differently, which means people won’t always understand what we’re trying to do, so we make extra effort to clearly communicate our goals. 

**Progress, progress, progress**

We adopt only those processes that help us progress.  Pragmatism first: we change what doesn’t work, not accepting inefficiency and impedance.
